## Rules To Make A Mosaic Crochet Chart
- Rows alternate color so that every odd row is the same color, and every even row is the same color.
- Every column of a color must begin on its own color row.
- All columns of color must have an odd number of cells.
- X's mark double crochets; place X's starting on the the 3rd block of every column and then every other block going up the column.
